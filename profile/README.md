# **Operation** (LABS)

## **Learn**

> Continuously absorb external and internal signals through market research, networking, technical documentation, operational data, and direct observation of workflows.
> 

## **Apply**

> Filter and contextualize what was learned against real internal problems. Ideas are only carried forward when they clearly map to operational pain, cost reduction, risk mitigation, or execution reliability.
> 

## **Build**

> Design and implement systems, processes, tooling, automation, or structural changes that address the validated problem. Simplicity is preferred over sophistication.
> 

## **Scale**

> Standardise, document, automate, and expand only what has proven effective. Scaling without evidence is treated as risk.
